## Overview

This software package uses the Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CGCNN) framework and M3gnet to create an un-supervised GNN that converges the internal degrees of freedom of a crystal lattice. The package is very simple, allowing you to train the model and predict converged cif files!
